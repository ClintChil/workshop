Hello World

HTTP and Webhooks
-----------------

When a web browser requests a web page it needs to talk to a web server. Browsers talk to servers using a language known as HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The language is simple and easy to understand and this request/response model of communication is referred to as REST, or `REpresentational State Transfer`. 

A simple HTTP request might look like:

.. code-block:: text

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: www.example.com
	
And the server response would be:

.. code-block:: text

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content Type: text/html
	 
	Response body appears hereâ€¦

The response is comprised of a header block and a content block. The ``Content Type`` header tells the browser how to interpret the response. If it had been ``image/png`` the browser would have known to expect PNG data, or in the case of ``application/json`` it would have expected a JSON formatted data response.

HTTP Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clients and servers need to pass information about the requests and response and do so by setting what are called headers. These headers can describe many things, among them the request type, the response type, and the server state.

While not required, it is up to the client to tell the server what kind of information it can accept.

A browser request for a web page should include an ``Accept`` header that tells the server what kind of information it can understand. Browsers can understand a wide range of information so their requests often look like:

.. code-block:: text

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: www.example.com
	Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml
	Accept-Language: en-US,en
	
This request tells the server how it can respond to the request in a way that the client will understand as well as how it can compress the response to reduce the size of the response content.

It is server's responsibility to tell the client how to interpret the response. As we saw above the ``Content Type`` header tells the browser what to expect in the content block of the response.

In the case of a server that requires authentication the response would also include an extra header that identifies the type of authentication required, for example:

.. code-block:: text

	HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
	Content Type: text/html
	WWW-Authenticate: Basic Realm="Protected Resource"
	
In this case an authorization response must be returned to access the resource. The response has to signify what kind of authentication scheme it is using and provide the proper credentials. HTTP authorization response a Base64 encoded string of the user's credentials in ``username:password`` format. So a response to an authentication response would include:

.. code-block:: text

	Authorization: Basic dHdpbGlvOnR3aWxpbyByb2Nrcw==

HTTP Headers in Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lets try this out on `Hurl.it <http://hurl.it/?url=http://www.twilio.com>`_ to see how we can change the way a server responds.

By just loading the server's response we see a content body of HTML that we can read. Now click on `add header`, enter ``Accept-Encoding`` and ``gzip,deflate`` and submit the request.

The response now includes a header ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` and the content body is compressed with gzip compression and is unreadable by mortal man.

HTTP Verbs/Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HTTP defines methods, also known as Verbs, that allow the request specify the action to perform on the resource. While there are many methods defined by HTTP, we only really need 4 of them to maintain a RESTful application structure.

**GET**
	The request is for a representation of the requested resource that is identified by the request URI.

**POST**
	The request is to submit data to be processed for the specified resource. This may create a new resource or update an existing resource.

**PUT**
	The request is to upload a representation of the specified resource that should be stored at the request URI.

**DELETE**
	The request is to delete the specified resource.

HTTP Cookies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An HTTP Cookie is a small piece of information that is sent in a server's response and stored by the client. When returning to the site the client will send that cookie data back to the server each time it requests a resource.

Cookies have many uses but are generally used to help the server identify returning users so that the server can maintain the state of your session. For example, after logging in to a website you are given a cookie that allows the server to identify you and verify that you are logged in during your browser session.

Twilio Account Portal
---------------------

Twimlets
--------

Hello World - SMS
-----------------

Let's send a text message using Python and the Twilio REST API. Open the
``send_sms.py`` file in your text editor. First, replace the dummy account
credentials with those of your own. Your account credentials can be found `on
the top of your Twilio account dashboard <https://www.twilio.com/user/account>`_.

.. literalinclude:: ../send_sms.py
   :lines: 1-4

On the next line, set `TO_NUMBER` to the number you used to sign up
with Twilio. During your free trial, you're only allowed to make calls and send
messages to numbers you've verified.

set `from_number` to your new Twilio number. if you
can't remember it, check the `numbers
<https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming>`_ section of your
account dashboard.

pick any message less than 140 characters to serve as the body.

.. literalinclude:: ../send_sms.py
   :lines: 6-8

With the above information, we construct a Twilio REST API client. We'll use
this to create and send a new text message.

.. literalinclude:: ../send_sms.py
   :lines: 10-

We're now ready to send a SMS message.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python send_sms.py

Your phone should be getting a message in a few seconds.

Hello World - Voice
-------------------

It's time to make a call to your phone using the REST API. 
Open ``make_call.py`` in your text editor and, just like the last section,
fill in your account credentials and phone numbers details.

With the above information, we construct a Twilio REST API client and create a
new call.

.. literalinclude:: ../make_call.py
   :lines: 8-

Run the script to start the call.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python make_call.py

Your phone should start ringing momentarily.


Introduction to TwiML
---------------------

We've successfully made a phone ring, but how do we actually control call flow?
`TwiML <https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml>`_ is the
answer. TwiML is a set of instructions you can use to tell Twilio what to do
when you receive an incoming call or SMS.
     
When someone makes a call or sends an SMS to one of your Twilio numbers, Twilio
will look up the URL associated with that phone number and make a request to
that URL. Twilio will read TwiML instructions at that URL to determine what to
do: record the call, play a message for the caller, prompt the caller to press
digits on their keypad, etc.

TwiML is an XML-based language and consists of five basic verbs.

* Say_
* Play_
* Gather_
* Record_
* Dial_

To see how these verbs work, let's take a look at the last section. When we
called your phone, a robot answered with a "Hello World" message. We now know
that TwiML powered that call, so let's take a look. Open
http://twimlets.com/message?Message[1]=Hello+World in your browser.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response><Say>Hello World</Say></Response>

This TwiML will do text-to-speech and say "Hello World". For outgoing calls, we
choose the TwiML URL at the time of the call. For incoming calls, we set a
TwiML URL that is fetched every time someone calls into our Twilio number.

Go to `your Twilio numbers page <https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming>`_ and click on your phone number. Change the "Voice URL" field to the Hello World URL

.. code-block:: bash

    http://twimlets.com/message?Message[1]=Hello+World

Now when you call your number, you should hear a "Hello World" greeting.

Twimlbin
~~~~~~~~

TwiML can be hosted anywhere. It can be a static XML document or created
dynamically by a web application. To make developing Twilio applications
easier, you can host your TwiML on `Twimlbin <http://twimlbin.com/>`_.

To create a new bin, go to the Twimlbin homepage and click "Create a new
Twimlbin". You can then use set your phone number's Voice URL to the "Public"
URL of your Twimlbin.

For the next sections, copy the sample TwiML and paste it into your Twimlbin
for easy experimentation.

Call Forwarding
---------------

The `Dial`_ verb allows you to connect calls to other people. The following
TwiML will forward any call to your Twilio phone number to your personal. Once
you've wired up this TwiML to your number, get a neighbor to test it out. 

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
      <Say>Please wait while we forward your call</Say>
      <Dial>YOUR PHONE NUMBER</Dial>
    </Resposne>


Voice Mailbox
-------------

Recording audio is accomplished through the `Record`_ verb. The Record verb
will play a beep and wait until a user presses # or hangs up. Copy this TwiML
into your bin and save. You can now leave messages on your number.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
      <Say>After the beep, record your message</Say>
      <Record/>
    </Resposne>

After you're done recording your message, hang up. Twilio begins processing the
recording right after your done. Head to your `recording log
<https://www.twilio.com/user/account/log/recordings>`_ to listen to your
message.


Private Conference Line
-----------------------

Many times during project assignments, you just need to get everyone on the
same page. You can now have your own private conference line using the
Conference noun and Dial verb. Put the following TwiML into your bin and save.
Give your Twilio number to a few people around you. Have everyone call in and
start up a conversation.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
      <Dial>
        <Conference>vip</Conference>
      </Dial>
    </Resposne>


Swiss-Army Phone Number
-----------------------

Equipped with the knowledge of TwiML, you can now bend your Twilio phone number
to your will. You've forwarded a call, recorded a message, and started a
private conference line. Your phone is now your's to control.

But don't think we're done yet, our second act will be creating application for
:ref:`voting`.
